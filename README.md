## Project Description
Concentration, also known as Match Match, Match Up, Memory, Pelmanism, Shinkei-suijaku, Pexeso or simply Pairs, is a card game in which players begin with a set of cards facing down, and 2 cards can be flipped facing up each turn to view their contents. If 2 flipped cards have the same content, then they will be kept facing up, otherwise, they will be flipped back down. The objective of the game is to match all the card pairs.

## Features
* Beautiful card flip animation made possible with Tailwind CSS.
* Card number selection to choose the number of cards to play with.
  * Possible card pairs include 8-cards, 14-cards, 20-cards and 30-cards.
* A timer to record your speed in completing the game.
* Randomized card contents every new game using Font Awesome.
